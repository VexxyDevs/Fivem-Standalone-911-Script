info about it:
what ive fixed/done:
ive changed the code so i dont use the exact same code as the 999 script i made we use similar but everything is changed to 911 and nothing to do with 999 is in there :).

what to expect in the future:
1. auto location to the call


2. better colors and the names changed (the call 911 call database & Emergency Center) may be changed to something better
